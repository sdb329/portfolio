          <h2>the story of an hour</h2>
          <h3>typography III, fall 2021</h3>
      
          <p>This was an experimental typography design that was based off of the short story The Story of An Hour by Kate Chopin. The piece is a long, double sided accordion fold with a vertical composition. The reason why this format was chosen was to accurately depict the idea of time passing, and to be able to split up and hide moments of the story that would give away the ending. On the first side, the audience is left on a cliff hanger, and turning the piece around reveals the remainder of the story. The piece is meant to be hung in the round so that both sides can be seen. </p>
